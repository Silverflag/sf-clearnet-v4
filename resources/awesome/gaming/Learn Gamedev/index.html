<h3>üíú Curated by <ins><a href="https://linktr.ee/dawdledoodles">Hazel Kennedy</a></ins> üíú</h3>

<p>Got resources? Notice a broken link? Email me, shoot me a DM, or make a pull request! I like chatting too - don't be shy! ^^</p>

<br />

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This list is aimed at learning the craft of game development. It has been curated to offer general knowledge, resources, and hiring advice for the variety of disciplines and roles under the gamedev umbrella.</p>

<p>Nearly all resources are free, and anything with a price tag will be clearly marked. Paid resources are only included if they have been personally endorsed by an industry professional working in the relevant discipline.</p>

<p>Suggestions and future-proofing efforts are always welcome! See <code>Contributing.md</code> for contribution guidelines, and check out <a href="https://github.com/notpresident35/learn-awesome-gamedev/issues">open issues</a> for tasks that need completing, such as archival work.</p>

<p>Generally, this lists avoids tools and assets. However, it contains courses/tutorials for specific tools wherever they are required for a role, and assets whenever they would enable a person to learn their role more effectively (for example, the animation section contains rigs). For tools, assets, communities, and more granular lists for individual tools like Unity, check out <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming">the gaming category of awesome</a></p>

<p>This list avoids including tutorials (within reason). It aims to help you develop your problem-solving skills and improve your general knowledge, rather than show you how to solve a particular problem. It also avoids design analysis videos, as they tend to be aimed at passive entertainment more than active learning. Both of these are easy to find and difficult to categorize. For curation purposes, this list errs on the side of exclusion.</p>

<p>These resources made my career possible. I hope they are just as helpful for you!</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I'm a technical artist and gameplay programmer, so most resources are geared towards tech and art. However, <em>most</em> disciplines are represented here in some fashion, particularly through general materials and other curated lists.</p>

<h2>Key</h2>

<p>üí† Starred Resources are "best for beginner" links. These include courses, classes, books, and lists aimed at people who are new to the games industry, or game development as a whole.</p>

<p>üü™ Purple Resources are ‚Äúmost useful‚Äù links. These include highly influential courses/books, resources I've personally found invaluable, and other entire mega-lists.</p>

<p><a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/how-game-engines-work">How Game Engines Work</a> üí† - A blog and video explaining the game engine, or a tool/framework used to create games.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamedev.tv/p/godot-complete-2d/?coupon_code=BLIMEY">Complete Godot 4 Game Deveoper by GameDev.tv</a> üí†üü™ - A fantastic way to learn Godot, a free and open source game engine. Gamedev.tv are an invaluable resource for learning game engines and tools, and I cannot recommend their courses enough. They are more than worth the $15.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/">Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer</a> üí†üü™ - Same as above, but with Unreal 5, a popular and powerful game engine. This course is invaluable - I know several full-time developers who learned from gamedev.tv, they are a gem. Wait for it to go on sale, then go pick this up.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/">Complete Unity Game Developer by GameDev.tv</a> - Unity has been a long-standing champion in the industry, particularly in the mobile/AR/VR space. Despite this, I would be cautious recommending it over other options, in part because of technical details such as its closed source and slow development, and in part due to poor business practices on behalf of Unity Technologies, such as the now-revoked install-based pricing model and their involvement in defense contracting.</p>
