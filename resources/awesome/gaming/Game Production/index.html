<p>A curated list of <strong>awesome</strong> resources, related to game production process - books, articles, tools, project management, methodologies - aimed to help game producers deliver their games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video<em>game</em>development">Video game development</a> (or production) is a process of developing a video game by a single person or a team of developers, not necessarily professionals or employed by someone to do so. This list is focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video<em>game</em>producer">game producer's</a> role - a person, who manages and orchestrates the game production process in multitude of ways. Hence the shortened list name.</p>

<p>This list does not cover specific disciplines like game design, quality assurance, programming. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#gaming">Gaming section</a> of the "master" awesome list for other gamedev stuff.</p>

<p>Majority of the provided resources are in English, but I might include items in other languages too, if you help me by <a href="https://github.com/vhladiienko/awesome-game-production/blob/main/contributing.md">creating a pull request</a>. Look for a flag next to the link.</p>

<li>🔥 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXmsxYm0Mk0">One-Page Designs</a> - You know how in agile you want to make sure your user stories are concise and <em>not</em> too detailed to incentivize communication? This video explains how you could apply the same principle to game design documents. Visualizing to make sure everyone discussing the design is on the same page also reminded me of the <a href="#story-mapping">User Story Mapping</a> book.

<h3>Courses</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/deeply-practical-project-management/">Deeply Practical Project Management</a> - This is what you'd call a "no BS" course on project management. Concise, to the point, and highly practical. It is not focused on game development, but I think you should still take it, because it closes many (if not all) gaps with just one course (~9 hours). Once completed, just adapt to your needs or just use some of the principles. It also includes numerous document templates and examples.</li>
