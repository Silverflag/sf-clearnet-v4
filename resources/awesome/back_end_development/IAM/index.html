<h2>Overview</h2>

<img align="right" width="50%" src="./assets/cloud-software-stack-iam.jpg"/>

<p>In a Stanford class providing an <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs349d/docs/L01_overview.pdf">overview of cloud computing</a>, the software architecture of the platform is described as in the right diagram ‚Üí</p>

<p>Here we set out the big picture: definition and strategic importance of the domain, its place in the larger ecosystem, plus some critical features.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io">The EnterpriseReady SaaS Feature Guides</a> - The majority of the features making B2B users happy will be implemented by the IAM perimeter.</li>

It's really hard.</a> - ‚ÄúOverly permissive AWS IAM policies that allowed <code>s3:GetObject</code> to <code>*</code> (all) resources‚Äù, led to \$80 million fine for Capital One. The only reason why you can't overlook IAM as a business owner.</li>

Stay in business; 2. Not jack up your prices; 3. Not deprecate services out from under you; 4. Provide more value to you in business acceleration than they take away in flexibility.‚Äù</li>
</('ul', 0)>
<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Security is one of the most central pillar of IAM foundations. Here are some broad concepts.</p>

<h2>Account Management</h2>

<p>The foundation of IAM: the definition and life-cycle of users, groups, roles and permissions.</p>

<h2>Cryptography</h2>

<p>The whole authentication stack is based on cryptography primitives. This can't be overlooked.</p>

<h2>Authorization</h2>

<p>Now we know you are you. But are you allowed to do what you want to do?</p>

<p>Policy specification is the science, enforcement is the art.</p>

<h3>Policy models</h3>

<p>As a concept, access control policies can be designed to follow very different archetypes, from classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list">Access Control Lists</a> to Role Based Access Control. In this section we explore lots of different patterns and architectures.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.osohq.com/post/why-authorization-is-hard">Why Authorization is Hard</a> - Because it needs multiple tradeoffs on Enforcement which is required in so many places, on Decision architecture to split business logic from authorization logic, and on Modeling to balance power and complexity.</li>

<h2>SAML</h2>

<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange authorization and authentication between services, like OAuth/OpenID protocols above.</p>

<p>Typical SAML identity provider is an institution or a big corporation's internal SSO, while the typical OIDC/OAuth provider is a tech company that runs a data silo.</p>

<h2>Trust & Safety</h2>

<p>Once you've got a significant user base, it is called a community. You'll then be responsible to protect it: the customer, people, the company, the business, and facilitate all interactions and transactions happening therein.</p>

<p>A critical intermediation complex driven by a policy and constraint by local laws, the Trust & Safety department is likely embodied by a cross-functional team of 24/7 operators and systems of highly advanced moderation and administration tools. You can see it as an extension of customer support services, specialized in edge-cases like manual identity checks, moderation of harmful content, stopping harassment, handling of warrants and copyright claims, data sequestration and other credit card disputes.</p>

<p>As stakeholder of the IAM stack, you're going to implement in the backend the majority of the primitives required to build-up the sign-up tunnel and user onboarding. This is the first impression customers will get from your product, and can't be overlooked: you'll have to carefully design it with front-end experts. Here is a couple of guides to help you polish that experience.</p>
