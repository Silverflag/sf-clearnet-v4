<p>If you would like to experience the functionality of something that is currently NOT working on one of these, contact <a href="mailto:sysadmin@silverflag.net">sysadmin@silverflag.net</a>. Thanks.</p>
<p>If there are issues of relative links being full path links, fix them in the github yourself, make them work no matter the location and explain your changes in the PR, and we will merge for you. Thanks again.</p>
